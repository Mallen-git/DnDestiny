While there&rsquo;s always a chance of running into a few haters, for the most part your followers are adoring and excited to spot you. They will reliably approach you in public and ask to capture images of themselves with you, and very commonly they will offer you drinks, food, and supplies. You may even be able to ask them collectively for help or favors. However, maintaining this popularity and goodwill is hard work. Your followers expect frequent posts, and if you fail to keep the nets up to date with your activity or don&rsquo;t get enough engagement, your follower count may drop, reducing the scope of your influence. Discuss with your Architect how to track this, and how it will affect you and your party.</span></p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"PGB pg:135","activation":{"type":"","cost":0,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":null},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":null,"actionType":"","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":null,"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"requirements":"Be Popular","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false}},"flags":{},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","effects":[],"_id":"jEakVzXXziCfyF0d"}
